# System Design Fundamentals

Transform your understanding of large-scale systems and ace your senior engineer interviews with this comprehensive system design course.

## What You'll Learn

This course covers everything you need to know about designing scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems:

### Core Concepts
- **Scalability**: Horizontal vs Vertical scaling
- **Reliability**: Fault tolerance and disaster recovery  
- **Consistency**: CAP theorem and eventual consistency
- **Performance**: Latency, throughput, and optimization

### System Components
- Load balancers and reverse proxies
- Databases: SQL vs NoSQL, sharding, replication
- Caching strategies: Redis, Memcached, CDN
- Message queues and event streaming

## Course Structure

### Module 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-2)
Learn the building blocks of distributed systems:

    C --> E[Database]
    D --> E[Database]
```

- System design principles
- Back-of-envelope calculations
- Common architectures and patterns

### Module 2: Storage & Databases (Weeks 3-4)
Master data storage solutions:

- **SQL Databases**: ACID properties, indexing, query optimization
- **NoSQL Databases**: Document, key-value, graph, column-family
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas, sharding strategies, federation

### Module 3: Caching & Performance (Weeks 5-6)
Optimize system performance:

- Cache patterns: Cache-aside, write-through, write-back
- Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
- Application-level caching strategies

### Module 4: Real-World Case Studies (Weeks 7-8)
Design complete systems:

> **Case Study 1**: Design Twitter
> - Timeline generation
> - Tweet storage and retrieval
> - User relationships and social graph
> 
> **Case Study 2**: Design YouTube  
> - Video upload and encoding pipeline
> - Global content distribution
> - Recommendation system architecture
