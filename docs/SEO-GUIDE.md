# SEO Guide for Tech Interview Website

## What is SEO?

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** is the practice of improving your website so that search engines like Google can find, understand, and rank your content higher in search results. When someone searches for "coding interview tips" or "system design course," good SEO helps your website appear at the top of the results.

Think of SEO as making your website "speak" the same language as search engines, so they can easily understand what your content is about and show it to people who are looking for it.

## Why SEO Matters for Your Business

- **More Visitors**: Higher search rankings = more people finding your site
- **Better User Experience**: SEO improvements often make your site faster and easier to use
- **Credibility**: People trust websites that appear at the top of search results
- **Cost-Effective Marketing**: Unlike ads, good SEO brings free, long-term traffic

## SEO Features Implemented in This Website

### 1. **Meta Tags** - Your Website's "Business Card"
Every page has special tags that tell search engines:
- What the page is about (title and description)
- Who wrote it (author)
- What topics it covers (keywords)
- When it was published/updated

**Example**: When someone shares your blog post on Facebook or Twitter, these tags control what title, description, and image appear.

### 2. **Structured Data** - Making Content Machine-Readable
We've added special code that helps search engines understand:
- Articles (blog posts) with author, publication date, and category
- Courses with pricing, instructor, and difficulty level
- Navigation paths (breadcrumbs)
- Your organization's contact information

**Why it matters**: This can make your content appear in special search result features like:
- Article snippets with author photos
- Course listings with prices
- Star ratings and reviews

### 3. **Sitemap** - A Map for Search Engines
Your website automatically generates a sitemap at `/sitemap.xml` that lists all pages in 3 languages. This helps search engines discover and index all your content quickly.

### 4. **Robots.txt** - Traffic Rules for Search Engines
Located at `/robots.txt`, this file tells search engines:
- Which pages they can visit
- Where to find your sitemap
- Which areas to avoid (like admin pages)

### 5. **Multi-Language SEO**
Each page automatically includes:
- Language-specific URLs
- Proper language tags for international SEO
- Alternative language versions for global reach
